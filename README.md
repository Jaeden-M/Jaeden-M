## Hi there 👋
- Hi, Jaeden
- I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering
- I chose my major because I've been interested in electronics after attending a summer "Engineering Academy" at Honolulu Community College
- A fun fact about me is: I love cats and going to raves
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  Learning more programming languages in general
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  The Giver; I'd recommend reading the book before watching the movie, as the movie skipped some aspects the book had.
